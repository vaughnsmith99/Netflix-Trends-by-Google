# Netflix-Trends-by-Google

# Project Description:

This project will be comparing the popularity of movie titles, rated by google trends, with their duration, the country they’re shown in, category, and rating. We will do this using two datasets, “Netflix Movies and TV Shows” by Shivam Bansal and “Google Trends Dataset” by Dhruvil Dave. The former dataset is updated monthly while the latter contains data from 2001 to 2020. Both of the datasets selected are sourced from Kaggle and have a usability rating of 10.0. These datasets source global data from their respective companies, we will be cleaning the data to only reflect trends in the United States.
